### Python module

This folder includes: 
* the APC and CPC models' implementation
* Script to obtain the scatter plots and correlation coefficients

### Data
This folder includes the data of the different experiments and the scatter plots.
json files:

* model\_language\_data.json: it contains the data points for each run in the form 
(epoch id, validation loss value, ABX across-speaker score, ABX within-speaker score)

* model\_language\_stats.json: it contains the statistical measures calcualted for the average performance 
and for each run.
